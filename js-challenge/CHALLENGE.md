1. Write a function insertAd(Collection arg) that takes collection as an argument and returns a collection with "advertisement" inserted after each 5th element.

```js
arg = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'advertisement', 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 'advertisement', 11, 12]
```

2. Write a function sortPairs(Collection pairs) that takes collection of pairs of integers (i,j) as an argument and returns a "sorted" collection by first element in pair (i).

```js
pairs = [[1,4], [6,8], [0,0], [4, 2]]
result = [[0,0], [1, 4], [4,2], [6,8]]
```
